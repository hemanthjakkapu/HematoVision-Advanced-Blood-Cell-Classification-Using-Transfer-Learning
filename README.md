# HematoVision-Advanced-Blood-Cell-Classification-Using-Transfer-Learning
**"HematoVision - Advanced Blood Cell Classification Using Transfer Learning"** introduces a pioneering approach to automate and enhance the accuracy of blood cell analysis, which is critical for diagnosing and monitoring a wide range of hematological disorders like anemia, leukemia, and infections. This project leverages the power of transfer learning, a deep learning technique that re-purposes pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently and effectively classify various types of blood cells from microscopic images. By building upon models already trained on vast datasets, "HematoVision" aims to overcome the limitations of traditional manual methodsâ€”such as their time-consuming nature and susceptibility to human errorâ€”and provide a robust, scalable, and highly accurate diagnostic aid for healthcare professionals.
